Notice
======

Sadly, GitHub has been acquired by Microsoft, which has a history of
actively trying to destroy or undermine the open source / free software
movement.
See the [Halloween documents](http://catb.org/~esr/halloween/) for some
examples of this.

For this reason I'm not comfortable hosting my open source code in Microsoft's
infrastructure and all my repositories have been moved to GitLab.
